      "Description": "My name is André Lie and I am a 31 year old web developer from Norway. I have a bachelor's degree in Multimedietechnology & Design from the University of Agder (UiA). I am currently looking for a job as a web developer, or a similar position. While studying at UiA, I have focused on programming and web development. I have also worked on several projects, both alone and in groups, where I have gained experience with project management, teamwork, and communication. I have also taken the initiative to learn technologies outside of the bachelor, such as C#, Unity, and React. I am a quick learner and I am always eager to learn new things. I am also a very creative person, and I enjoy working on projects where I can use my creativity. I am passionate about creating interactive experiences on the web, and I am always looking for new challenges."

      "Description": "I've always been interested in computers and technology, and from a young age I've shown an interest in exploring and figuring out how things work. From the first time I got my hands on a computer, I've been fascinated by the possibilities it offers and the possibilities it offers. I sadly never got the chance to explore this interest further, as I was never introduced to programming in school and ended up studying something completely different. But from the moment I started studying at UiA, I knew I wanted to become a programmer, as theres nothing I enjoy more than breaking down bigger problem and solving them piece by piece. I also enjoy working on projects where I can use my creativity, and I feel like programming is the perfect combination of creativity and problem solving."
